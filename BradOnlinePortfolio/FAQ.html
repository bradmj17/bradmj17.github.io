                    <h2>Would You Be Willing To Travel For Employment?</h2>
                    <p>The answer is yes. I've become aware that living in Idaho means there's less tech companies nearby. I've already decided, given the opportunity, that I would travel for a job.</p>
                <hr>
                    <h2>How would you describe yourself?</h2>
                    <p>To a fault, I strive to impress others. I go to great lengths to ensure happiness for my friends, family, and employers. In general, I'm quite reserved and I'm okay with keeping to myself.</p>
                <hr>
                    <h2>How would you describe your work ethic?</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy putting my head down, putting on a podcast, and grinding out several hours for a job. I often get lost in my work and lose track of time under the condition that it's a project I'm passionate about.</p>
                <!--section that goes to my hobbies, scrapped; was never included in ribbon menu
                    <hr>
                    <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
                    <p>I've prepared a standalone page if you are interested in seeing what my interests are. This includes what video games I enjoy, outdoor activities, and my favorite sports teams. The page is <a href="Interests.html">here</a>.</p>-->

            <div class="column">
                <h2>Which Programming Languages Have You Learned?</h2>
                    <p>C#, HTML, CSS</p>
                        <hr>
                <h2>Are you an American Citizen?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I am a first-generation American in my family.</p>
                        <hr>
                <h2>AutoCAD experience?</h2>
                    <p>I took four years throughout high school doing AutoCAD drafting. Not only AutoCAD, but I learned Inventor, SOLIDWORKS, and Revit.</p>
                    <p>I was adept in my class, although I never competed in any global events such as SkillsUSA</p>
                    <p>I had a summer internship at Western Water Works Supply in Nampa, Idaho and it blossomed into working for them. More about that <a href="experience.html">here</a>.</p>
                        <hr>
                <h2>Do you enjoy collaborating with others?</h2>
                    <p>I've enjoyed working with others because I with different ideas come different possibilities. Each individual brings a different set of skills to the table, as well as different perspectives when it comes to problem solving. Additionally, achieving success as a group is a greater feeling than alone.</p>
