                        <p class="manual_topmarg">Here's a list of incredible games that have motivated me to pursue Software Development as a career.</p>
                        <p>While it's unclear whether my career path will diverge into the production of video games, gaming is a time-consuming hobby for me. Each of these games have had some relevance in my life.</p>
                        <p>Each of these are very unique and impressive to me.</p>

                <div class="column">
                <p class="manual_topmarg">Mountain Biking is a newer hobby I've picked up in the last few years. I had suffered several back-to-back hamstring injuries that have led me to avoiding higher-impact activities akin to regular cardio such as jogging or sprinting.</p>
                <p>I own a 2016 Carbon Specialized Stumpjumper and have been riding both road and trail.</p>
                <p>There's a good community around the Nampa-Boise area and some. It's a good low-impact alternative over jogging or sprinting.</p>

                    <h2>European Football</h2>
                        <p class="manual_topmarg">I've been following European Football since early 2016 and it's grown into my favorite sport. I attached myself to Manchester City, which has grown to be one of the more successful Premier League teams over the course of the past six years.</p>
                        <p>My favorite player is Kevin De Bruyne.</p>

                    <h2>Track and Field</h2>
                        <p class="manual_topmarg">I had played soccer for my entire life up until freshman year of high school. That year, I decided to try track and field. It turned out I was a great sprinter and I was quickly a member of my high school's varisty team. The following year, I left my soccer club and joined a track and field club based out of Boise called <a href="https://idahodashtrack.com/" target="_blank">Idaho Dash Track Club</a>.</p>
                        <p>The coaches fostered me into a great track and field athlete, and I ran the 100m, 200m, 400m, 4x100m, 4x200m, and the 4x400m; I was a sprinter. Unfortunately, some injuries and COVID-19 soured my opportunity to compete on the college level.</p>
