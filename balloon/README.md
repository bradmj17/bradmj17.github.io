These are the files for the activity at the end of Part 3 of the [Create Modern CSS Animations](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5625816-create-modern-css-animations) course on [Open Classrooms](http://openclassrooms.com/).

While working on the activity, if you want to use the sass files instead of editing the css file directly, then if you have [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) installed you can run 

```
$ sass --watch scss:css
```
 
 in your local directory to have the sass files compile in to the css file that's referenced in `index.html`

 **Happy hacking!**
