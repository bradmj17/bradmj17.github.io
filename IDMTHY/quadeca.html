        <h1>Quadeca</h1>
        <p>Benjamin Lasky (b. October 2, 2000), better known by his stage name Quadeca (formerly known as Quadecax8), is a rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, and YouTuber. His YouTube channel has racked up over 2 million subscribers from making popular content about soccer, music, and reactions. His channel was first launched in 2012, where he became known for making FIFA videos while also incorporating rap.</p>
        <p>He released his debut album Work in Progress in September of 2015 at the age of 14, including his most popular single, “Wii Music Fire” He also has many other popular singles such as “Who Would’ve Thought,” “Idontwannaspeakagain,” and “Wonderful” from his Out of Order (2017) album that debuted in the top 100 iTunes charts.</p>
        <p>Quadeca has collaborated with other artists including K.A.A.N, Moxas, and many others, which has overall expanded his musical portfolio drastically.</p>
        <p>On a November 2018 episode of Miniminter and Randolph’s “What’s Good?” podcast, guest KSI called out Quadeca, calling his track “Unusual” “dead,” and calling out Quadeca in other ways. This inspired Quadeca to make a diss track on KSI, and KSI responded with his own diss track, “Ares.” This boosted Quadeca’s following tremendously.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2021, Quadeca released his second studio album completely independently through AWAL Distribution titled “From Me To You”. The album received immense praise from fans and has quickly become his most notable body of work to date. On November 3, 2021 Quadeca dropped the deluxe edition of “From Me To You” including six new additional tracks.</p>
