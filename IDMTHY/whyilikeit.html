        <h1>Why I Like It.</h1>
        <p>Years ago, my friend told me to listen to "Wonderful" by Quadeca. Just a harmless song to listen to before a soccer game. Now years have gone by where I've grown up listening to Quadeca's music and becoming entralled by the worlds he creates. The themes in his music are some of the most profound
          and life-changing music I've consumed. Most specifically his last three albums: Voice Memos, From Me To You, and I Didn't Mean to Haunt You (pictured below from left to right).
          Watching him evolve as an artist inspires me to become a better person and evolve myself. Listening to his music allows me to be introspective on
          my own life and how I can overcome mountains in my own life and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6LqXiAK-80" target="_blank">Fractions of Infinity</a>. 
        </p>
      <br><br>

            <img src="../images/voicememos.jpg" alt="Voice Memos Album Art" class="albums">
            <h2>Voice Memos</h2>
            <p>This album was the first that I liked from him, and I listened to it in high school. While it does a lot to appeal to the younger crowd (which was his demographic at the time), some of the songs still hold up in big ways. At the time, it did enough to mix great lyricism with what was the modern trap beats. This would now be in the category of guilty pleasure music for me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ben explores topics like feeling bipolar when it comes to large decisions, becoming a larger artist, and how finding love helped find meaning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my favorite songs would be:<br>-Ego Death <br>-A Dream I Can't Remember (Interlude)<br>-The Man on My Left Shoulder<br>-Eyes<br>-These Days</p>

            <h2>From Me To You</h2>
            <p>FMTY came out just as I was beginning college. There was a large leap between Voice Memos and this, and it's obvious to see that Quadeca had matured dramatically between releases.
              The album features Quadeca experimenting with dramatic soundscapes alongside glitch-pop. The overall message is once again overcoming shortcomings and accepting your own problems.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The song Sisyphus is a standout on the album, and alone is a masterpiece.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my favorite songs would be:<br>-Sisyphus <br>-Shades of Us<br>-Summit, Pt. 1<br>-Maybe Another Day<br>-Candles on Fire!</p>

            <h2>I Didn't Mean To Haunt You</h2>
            <p>This album came out early 2022, and I couldn't be more grateful. This is the most complete project Quadeca has made to date. I will cherish this album for a long time, and likely compare other media to this. In terms of environment, music production, and lyricism.. IDMTHY is unbeatable. This is the first album that critics have paid attention to, and recieved great ratings.</p>
            <p>This is an awful album to relate to, as the concept is a post-humous album of Quadeca after he's killed himself. The fan theory as to why this is the storyline is because one of his friends passed away. The album explores his thoughts when dying, viewing the world as a ghost, and his relations to his family, friends and fans and how they moarn and how Quadeca becomes tired of them grieving. Quadeca's ghost is tired of his family grieving and
              poisons them with carbon monoxide. All the lyrics are dissonant and the production is overbearing all on purpose to make for an eerie experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              An incredibly dark, morbid story. I love this album because of how unique it is.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of my favorite songs would be:<br>-sorry4dying <br>-tell me a joke<br>-born yesterday<br>-knots<br>-fractions of infinity</p>
