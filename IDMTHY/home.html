        <h1>Why I like Quadeca</h1>
        <p>I Didn’t Mean To Haunt You is Quadeca’s third studio album, and a follow-up to his previous album, From Me To You. According to Quadeca, the album’s theme takes place right after the end of From Me To You, with Quadeca himself explaining that the album comes from the perspective of a ghost and conveys feelings of loneliness and death. On September 19th, he released the lead single to the album, titled “Born Yesterday”, and on October 25th, released the second and final single from the album, titled “Tell Me A Joke”. Both singles released alongside music videos.</p>
        <p>On the same day “Tell Me A Joke” was released, Quadeca announced the album’s cover art and tracklist through Twitter and Instagram, revealing that the album contains guest features from Danny Brown, Sunday Service Choir, and ex-Swans member Thor Harris. The album was released on November 11, 2022, along with an album movie. And a few days later Quadeca released a music video for the 10th track “Fractions of infinity”</p>
